# My Tech

Hi! Here I just publish my devices and theirs descriptions, let's start!

# Computers

## Acer Aspire 5250

**Year (built + bought):** February 2012
**CPU:** AMD E-300 1.3 Ghz
**GPU:** Radeon HD 6310 (integrated)
**RAM:** 4GB DDR3 (can be upgraded up to 8GB, 4+4)
**Storage:** Hitachi HDD 500GB (I also have 250GB SSD, but for me speed isn't very important)

**Note:** I got him from one person as a gift for free maybe 3-4 years ago. It's just a nice laptop which I use every day. I installed Arch Linux + i3wm on him. I even don't have a file manager on him, so all what I do on him it's all terminal only. GUI apps on him are only Firefox and that's all. Codes I write in vim, because other code editors work very slow on him.

He is very reliable and pretty durable. Condition of my own 5250 is not too good (damage on screen, damage on lid, no camera, no microphone, damaged cooling (still up to 60C), damaged keyboard (3 keys are loosed and ESC doesn't work), no battery + damaged slot for battery, no DVD (removed), rust in all USB ports, damaged speakers, died CMOS (like, any CR2023 batteries can't work on him, and that's the reason of no clock and date on this laptop), damaged screen holders, damaged screws etc), but he still works as new! I like that machine, because she is very cheap but still good enough for browsing, YouTube in 360p, and even LibreOffice.

I prefer not to use smartphones, so on my phone I have only calls and SMS. For all things as note taking, study, listening to music, and of course coding, I use only this laptop.

With him I'm able to do some simple work in **GIMP**, **Kdenlive (1 minute of stock video takes 10-15 minutes to export in 720p)**, **Audacity**, **Vim** etc. To run **Firefox** on him it takes maybe 30 seconds to run him, and also 20 seconds to wait when he sill stop to freeze.

For coding this laptop is pretty decent, because he can easily edit files of any size (even 100MB+). I can write apps and codes, but probably some of them will never be compiled on him.

**YouTube** he can pretty easy run in 240-360p, what is enough if you don't run video in fullscreen and at display of your laptop is 1366x768. At all it's also not a problem to download a video and run it in vlc. In vlc I can watch any video with comfort even if it's a 720p 1 hour video.

Also I like his speakers, which are even damaged have a better sound than Acer Aspire A515-56 from 2020-2021.

**CONCLUSION:** If your budget is 15-25 dollars, I think that this laptop really worth your money. I use him every day and maybe 6-8 hours, and as you can see it's not a problem. I fully finished one school year with him (I was using **LibreOffice** for my note taking). I personally got him for free, from one of my relatives. This GPU and CPU are terrible, but I like that I can install up to 8GB of RAM in him.

I know that probably you have thoughts in a kind of -"He is crazy and it's not possible to live with this laptop", but I was using a lot of laptops with the latest generations of Intel Core i7-9, and I would like to say that person gets used to everything. You can adapt yourself to everything, and even to this old laptop)))

NOTE: Some days ago it was a very rainy weather in my city. I was waiting for a bus with a laptop inside my not waterproof backpack for a pretty long time, and when I came back to home and opened my laptop, I noticed that his display is literally destroyed by water. He has something in a kind of very bright flat liquid on the right side on his display. Looks terrible, but it's still possible to see everything what I need. Also he was fully filled with water inside (keyboard, HDD, all ports etc.), but it still works as new :)

EDIT 10/06/2024: This laptop doens't have any signs of liquid on his screen anymore, but as a "shadow" of what happened some time ago display has something in a kind of white bright dot's, each dot is I think 1-2mm and he has approximately 15-20 of them. Still usable at all. I bought a VGA cable and connected this laptop to external monitor (TV), and found that it works really fine in 1920x1080  + 60 FPS.

## ThinkPad T430 (goal)

I don't have this laptop, but I really want to buy him. I'm trying to sell my Acer Aspire 5250, all smartphones, and some details for computers which I have and then I will get enough money to buy this laptop. I have a lot of different "digital" hobbies, and I think that this laptop will be good enough for it. I think that i5 of 3 Gen will be pretty enough for simple tasks in music production and of course coding. At all it will be definitely better than my Acer Aspire 5250!

# Devices

**Keyboard:** Logitech K120

My favorite keys. I like that this keyboard is wired (I prefer to use only wired tech) and that she is the best for her price. I use her with touch typing method in QWERTY, and it's very comfortable to type on her. I can easily get 95WPA or more on her.

**Mouse:** Logitech M100 (also I have something in a kind of Logitech B100, but can't find any information about her)

Just a good mouse. I use her maybe more than 1 year, and my favorite thing in her that she is portable and light. Maybe in the future I will buy a Logitech G502 HERO (wired), but for now I actually don't need it. I think that mouse matters only in video/photo editing, but not in coding when I never use my mouse at all.

**Headphones:** Sony MDR-7506, Sennheiser HD206

Them I use only for my beatmaking hobby, because all my other tasks can be completed without any sound. Sennheiser sounds sooo good, even for music production. But, I decided to buy Sony MDR-7506 because they are better for music production.

I think that if you don't write music and just listen to her Sennheiser HD206 should be the best choice for you. I compared their sound with Apple AirPods (which I got for some days from my friend) anddd... Sennheiser is better, in my opinion of course. I bought them for 26 euro maybe 2 years ago, and they are still in a very good conditon. I only have to change earpads, but of course it's not very important and shouldn't affect their sound in any way.

**Noname Cooling Pad:** At all he is always turned off, but it's a very good stand which decreased amount of dust inside my laptop. He can reduce temperature on 5-10 *C, but it depends from your laptop model.

**Smartphone:** During last year I was using a lot of phone, but in conlusion I decided to live with a simple Nokia 105 2019. I just... like to live like that.
