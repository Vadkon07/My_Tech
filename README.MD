# My Tech

Hi! Here I just publish my devices and theirs descriptions, let's start!

# Computers

## Acer Aspire 5250

**Year (bought):** 2012
**CPU:** AMD E-300 1.3 Ghz
**GPU:** Radeon HD 6310 (integrated)
**RAM:** 4GB DDR3
**Storage:** Hitachi HDD 500GB (I also have 250GB SSD, put prefer not to use him because it will be expensive to buy new)

**Note:** I got him from one person as a gift for free maybe 3-4 years ago. It's just a nice laptop which I use every day. I installed Arch Linux + i3wm on him. I even don't have a file manager on him, so all what I do on him it's all terminal only. GUI apps on him are only Firefox and that's all. Codes I write in vim, because other code editors work very slow on him.

He is very reliable and pretty durable. Condition on my own 5250 is not too good (damage on screen, damage on lid, no camera, no microphone, damaged cooling (still up to 60C), damaged keyboard (3 keys are loosed and ESC doesn't work), no battery + damaged slot for battery, no DVD (removed), rust in all USB ports, damaged speakers, damaged screen holders, damaged screws etc), but he still works as new! I like that machine, because she is very cheap but still good enough for browsing, YouTube in 360p, and even LibreOffice.

I prefer not to use smartphones, so on my phone I have only mobile hotspot, calls, and SMS. For all things as note taking, study, listening to music, and of course coding, I use only this laptop.

With him I'm able to do some simple work in **GIMP**, **Kdenlive (1 minute of stock video takes 10-15 minutes to export in 720p)**, **Audacity**, **Vim** etc. To run **Firefox** on him it takes maybe 30 seconds to run him, and also 20 seconds to wait when he sill stop to freeze.

For coding this laptop is pretty decent, because he can easily edit files of any size (even 100MB+). I can write apps and codes, but probably some of them will never be compiled on him.

**YouTube** he can pretty easy run in 240-360p, what is enough if you don't run video in fullscreen and at display of your laptop is 1366x768.

**CONCLUSION:** If your budget is 15-25 dollars, I think that this laptop really worth your monry. I use him every day and maybe 6-8 hours, and as you can see it's not a problem. I fully finished one school year with him (I was using **LibreOffice** for my note taking).

I know that probably you have thoughts in a kind of -"He is crazy and it's not possible to live with this laptop", but I was using a lot of laptops with the latest generations of Intel Core i7-9, and I would like to say that person gets used to everything. You can adapt yourself to everything, and even to this old laptop)))

NOTE: So, some days ago it was a very rainy weather in my city. I was waiting for a bus with a laptop inside my not waterproof backpack for a pretty long time, and when I came back to home and opened my laptop, I noticed that his display is literally destroyed by water. He has something in a kind of very bright flat liquid on the right side on his display. Looks terrible, but it's still possible to see everything what I need. Also he was fully filled with water inside (keyboard, HDD, all ports etc.), but it still works as new :)

## ThinkPad T480 (goal)

I don't have this laptop, but I really want to own him!

# Devices

**Keyboard:** Logitech K120

My favorite keys. I like that this keyboard is wired (I prefer to use only wired tech), and that she is the best for her price.

**Mouse:** Logitech M100 (also I have something in a kind of Logitech B100, but can't find any information about her)

Just a good mouse. I use her maybe more than 1 year, and my favorite thing in her that she is portable and light.

**Headphones:** Sony MDR-7506, Sennheiser HD206

Them I use only for my beatmaking hobby, because all my other tasks can be completed without any sound.

**Cooling Pad:** At all he is always turned off, but it's a very good stand which decreased amount of dust inside my laptop.

**Smartphone:** For now I use (maybe 2 minutes a day) iPhone 6s. I like that he is very simple and portable, but he should be always connected to my laptop's port to be able to charge, because his battery is enough up to 1h of modem usage. Also I have Samsung Galaxy M32, but I decided to save him for future when I will actually need him.
