# My Tech

Hi! Here I just publish my devices and theirs descriptions, let's start!

# Computers

## Acer Aspire 5250

**Year (bought):** 2012
**CPU:** AMD E-300 1.3 Ghz
**GPU:** Radeon HD 6310 (integrated)
**RAM:** 4GB DDR3
**Storage:** Hitachi HDD 500GB (I also have 250GB SSD, put prefer not to use him because it will be expensive to buy new)

**Note:** I got him from one person as a gift for free maybe 3-4 years ago. It's just a nice laptop which I use every day. I installed Arch Linux + i3wm on him. I even don't have a file manager on him, so all what I do on him it's all terminal only. GUI apps on him are only Firefox and that's all. Codes I write in vim, because other code editors work very slow on him.

He is very reliable and pretty durable. Condition on my own 5250 is not too good (damage on screen, damage on lid, no camera, no microphone, damaged cooling (still up to 60C), damaged keyboard (3 keys are loosed and ESC doesn't work), no battery + damaged slot for battery, no DVD (removed), rust in all USB ports, damaged speakers, damaged screen holders, damaged screws etc), but he still works as new! I like that machine, because she is very cheap but still good enough for browsing, YouTube in 360p, and even LibreOffice.

I prefer not to use smartphones, so on my phone I have only mobile hotspot, calls, and SMS. For all things as note taking, study, listening to music, and of course coding, I use only this laptop.

## ThinkPad T480 (goal)

I don't have this laptop, but I really want to own him!

# Devices

**Keyboard:** Logitech K120

My favorite keys. I like that this keyboard is wired (I prefer to use only wired tech), and that she is the best for her price.

**Mouse:** Logitech M100 (also I have something in a kind of Logitech B100, but can't find any information about her)

Just a good mouse. I use her maybe more than 1 year, and my favorite thing in her that she is portable and light.

**Headphones:** Sony MDR-7506, Sennheiser HD206

Them I use only for my beatmaking hobby, because all my other tasks can be completed without any sound.

**Cooling Pad:** At all he is always turned off, but it's a very good stand which decreased amount of dust inside my laptop.

**Smartphone:** For now I use (maybe 2 minutes a day) iPhone 6s. I like that he is very simple and portable, but he should be always connected to my laptop's port to be able to charge, because his battery is enough up to 1h of modem usage. Also I have Samsung Galaxy M32, but I decided to save him for future when I will actually need him.
